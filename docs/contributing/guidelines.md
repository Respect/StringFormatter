## What to Avoid

- Break backward compatibility unless necessary
- Use PHP without strict typing
- Commit sensitive information

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- PHP version
- Library version
- Complete error messages
- Minimal reproducible example
- Expected vs actual behavior
